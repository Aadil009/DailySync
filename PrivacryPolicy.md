# Privacy Policy for DailySync

Effective Date: 29 November 2024

## Introduction

Welcome to DailySync ("we", "our", "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your experience using our mobile application is safe and secure. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when you use our app.

As a news app, DailySync does not collect or access any personal data or information from users. We do not track or store any personal information about you.

## Information We Do Not Collect

We do not collect, store, or process any personal data. Specifically:

- **Personal Information:** We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII), such as your name, email address, phone number, or physical address.
- **Location Data:** We do not collect or track your geographical location.
- **Usage Data:** We do not collect or track any usage data, such as app interaction or behavioral analytics.
- **Device Information:** We do not collect information about your device, such as model, operating system, or IP address.

## Third-Party Services

Our app may include third-party content, such as news sources, advertisements, or links. However, we do not collect any data from these third parties, nor do we share any personal information with them.

If our app uses any third-party services (for example, for displaying ads or content), please refer to their privacy policies to understand how they collect and use information.

## Advertising

DailySync does not collect personal information for the purpose of advertising. If any ads are displayed in the app, they are served by third-party ad networks. These networks may collect anonymous data such as device type, location, and other non-personally identifiable information for the purpose of serving advertisements. We do not control how these third parties collect and use your data, and we encourage you to review their privacy policies.

## Security

We prioritize the security of our users' data. Since we do not collect any personal data, we do not store sensitive information, and thus there are no personal details to protect. We recommend you use appropriate security measures such as device passcodes, biometrics, and other device-level security features.

## Children's Privacy

Our app does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13. If you believe that we may have inadvertently collected personal data from a child under 13, please contact us immediately so that we can delete such information.

## Updates to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in this document with an updated "Effective Date." We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your privacy.
